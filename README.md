# Calculus Calculator Made in Python V3.11.4
## Description
This program was made for personal use when I completed AP Calculus BC last year. I made it so that anyone else could run the program, it would give a formatted version using SymPy, show the steps, and finally give an answer.
## How to use the program
All you have to do is simply:
1) Run the program
2) Select the variable letter (I only have support for single variables; not implicit or multivariable)
3) Enter the expression (Make sure to put it in with parenthesis so as not to confuse the program about what expression is being typed out)
4) Press enter and watch the magic happen!
